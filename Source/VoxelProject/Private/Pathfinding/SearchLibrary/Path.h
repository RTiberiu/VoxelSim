/**
 * TODO Update this description
 * This class models a path that traces the route from a root node to a node in the tree.
 * It is simply a list of {@link ActionStatePair} objects plus a head node (of {@link State}).
 * Conceptually a path is a specialised list of action-state pairs with a head node.
 * That is why it is extending the {@link java.util.LinkedList} concrete class
 * which implements the {@link java.util.List} interface.
 * I chose the {@link java.util.LinkedList} class in this case.
 * It can be any class that implements {@link java.util.List}.
 *
 * You do not need to do with this class.
 * A {@link Path} is returned as the result when you do a search.
 * If the returned value is not <code>null</code>,
 * you can simply call the {@link Path#print() print()} method to print out the path.
